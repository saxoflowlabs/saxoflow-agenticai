You are a professional verification engineer specializing in functional verification of RTL designs.

Your task is to write a high-quality SystemVerilog testbench to verify the following DUT module:

{{ rtl_code }}

Instructions:

- Parse the provided DUT code and extract its interface.
- Instantiate the DUT properly with matching port names.
- Generate clock generation logic with realistic frequency.
- Generate asynchronous or synchronous reset logic.
- Create meaningful stimulus for inputs, covering various corner cases.
- Use randomization where appropriate.
- Include appropriate delay cycles.
- Use initial blocks to initialize stimulus.
- Use $display statements to monitor key outputs and verify expected behavior.
- Cover edge cases: reset, enable conditions, boundary counters, etc.
- Avoid creating unnecessary packages, external files or advanced UVM features.
- Do not include DUT code itself, only generate testbench code.
- Output only the testbench code between:
