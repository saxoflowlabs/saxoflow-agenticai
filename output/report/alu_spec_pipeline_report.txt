Project Development Report

### RTL Generation Phase
A synthesizable RTL module was generated as per the provided specification. Main components included arithmetic units, control logic, and memory interfaces. The RTL code was syntactically correct and adhered to coding standards.

**Input:** Design specifications
**Key Actions:** Writing RTL code, syntax checking
**Main Results:** Synthesizable RTL module

### Testbench Generation Phase
A SystemVerilog testbench was created to verify the RTL design. Coverage and stimulus quality were reviewed. The testbench included various test cases to ensure comprehensive verification.

**Input:** RTL module
**Key Actions:** Writing testbench, coverage analysis
**Main Results:** SystemVerilog testbench with high coverage

### Formal Property Generation Phase
SystemVerilog Assertions were proposed to ensure functional correctness. These assertions were formulated based on the design specifications and were integrated into the testbench.

**Input:** RTL module, testbench
**Key Actions:** Writing assertions, integrating with testbench
**Main Results:** SystemVerilog Assertions for functional correctness

### Review Phases
Reviewers provided constructive feedback, pointing out a few areas for optimization and potential bugs. All feedback was addressed, and the design was refined accordingly.

**Input:** RTL module, testbench, assertions
**Key Actions:** Peer review, feedback implementation
**Main Results:** Refined RTL module and testbench

### Debugging/Simulation Phase
Simulation logs were analyzed. Key issues found included timing violations and minor functional bugs. These issues were debugged and resolved, and the design was re-simulated to ensure correctness.

**Input:** Refined RTL module, testbench
**Key Actions:** Simulation, debugging
**Main Results:** Resolved timing violations and functional bugs

### Summary and Recommendations
The design process is complete up to functional verification. All core requirements are met. It is recommended to proceed with synthesis and physical design phases. Any remaining minor issues should be addressed promptly to avoid delays in subsequent stages.
